	<p>Hello! I am a NYC based UX designer with an industrial design background.

	<br>I’m passionate about people and understanding their behaviors and necessities in the context of design. I love listening to the stories of others to better understand their current needs. My interest lies in coming up with solutions that can better serve the user’s experience through simple, creative and intuitive design.</br>

	<br>When not designing, I enjoy spending time painting nails, editing photos for Instagram and hunting for new restaurants.</br>
